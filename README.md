# TestingGrounds

Clash between FPS and stealth (?) game. Based on [Udemy course by Ben Tristem](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/)

# Basic GDD:

## Rules

* Player's goal is to survive as long as possible
* Game is divided in separate phases. To progress a player has to kill or sneak past all of the AI characters
* Way forward is open at the start of the phase. Being spotted by an enemy blocks the progress (force field? huge door?). Killing all enemies raises the blockade.
* Progressing to next phase block the way back
* The game has no fixed end
* MAYBE: a point based shop. Player can earn points for completing phases to buy upgrades with. Bonus points for sneaking/high health at the end of phase/not getting hit

## Requirements:
* Character skeletal meshes, animations and textures
* Gun and projectile meshes, textures and sounds
* Landscape meshes and textures.
* Ambient sounds (music?)
